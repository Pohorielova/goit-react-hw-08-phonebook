# Welcome to the PhoneBook React App!

This app was built using React, Redux, and React Router. The PhoneBook React App
allows users to keep track of their contacts. Users can add new contacts, edit
existing contacts, and delete contacts. The app also includes a search feature
to help users find specific contacts.

## Setup

To get started, you can run the app by running the command npm start in your
terminal. This will start the development server and you can view the app in
your browser at http://localhost:3000.
